    **Histplot Insight:**  
    The price distribution is **bimodal**, showing two distinct price peaks, likely representing different item categories.  
    Significant gaps exist between bars, especially between the two main price clusters and in higher price ranges,  
    indicating a lack of data in those intervals.  
    The distribution is slightly **right-skewed** due to some higher-priced items.
             

    **Violinplot Insight:**  
    Ratings are mostly high, clustering around 4.4, with a multimodal distribution showing distinct rating groups. 
    Few ratings are below 4.1, and the plot highlights the range and spread of ratings, indicating generally positive feedback.


    **Barplot Insight:**  
    The discount distribution is uneven, favoring specific percentages like 11, 13, 15, 25, and 27. 
    Discounts in the mid-range (around 16-20) are less frequent. 
    The chart shows a range of discounts from near 0 to 40, suggesting distinct, rather than continuous, discount strategies.


    **Histplot Insight:**  
    Battery capacities are heavily concentrated around 5000 mAh, with a smaller peak around 4500 mAh. 
    Almost all batteries fall within these two ranges, showing a strong preference for high-capacity batteries. 
    A tiny fraction has very low capacity.
